Abstract:
This thesis introduces and studies erasing systems as an alternative formal language model to general jumping finite automata. A significant difference compared to the given automata is the use of a control regular language instead of state control in the form of a general finite automaton. Erasing systems leave the string work on the input tape, whereas regular languages themselves can be accepted by classical finite automata. At the same time, with the introduction of a new formal system, the thesis demonstrates its relations with well-known language families, the family of shuffle languages, Dyck languages and closure properties. Based on the formal specification of the erasing system, multiple applications in bioinformatics for molecular biology, text editors and compositional chess are shown, including designing algorithms and presenting the implementation solution.

Keywords:
erasing system, jumping finite automata, regulated grammars and automata, erasing operation, comparison with other language-defining formal devices, closure properties, application of formal models, open problems, new areas of research
